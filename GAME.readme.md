### Concept

There is a grid with 3x3 that allow the player to use arrow key to move from any direction, each of the move will cause the disaster appear randomly from 1-5 blocks. So it's require a player to predict their move base on the hint on the screen like

"Go to the top of the mountain always dangerous!"
=> The diaster will be appear on the top from 1 - 3

"Did you know that stay in the middle of the ground always safety"
=> Keep moving in the middle will be safe lol
